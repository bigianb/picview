PicView
=======

This software is very embryonic - feel free to browse the code for ideas but don't expect a product
which you can easily use.

PicView is a program to allow me to do more with my Picasa 3 organised picture collection.
I have a large collection of pictures and videos which I have spent a lot of time curating in Picasa
- in particular tagging faces.

My plan is to synchronise my picture collection amongst the various PCs and laptops in the household
using bittorrent sync. I also plan to use an Intel NUC running linux to provide a browser based view onto the collection
and to back-up to an off-site store such as Amazon S3.

This particular software aims to read the Picasa DB to support the browser based interface onto the collection.
